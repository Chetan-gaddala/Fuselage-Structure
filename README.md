# Fuselage-Structure
Noise Reduction in Commercial Aircrafts by Modelling and Analysis of Fuselage Structures
This project investigates methods for reducing cabin noise in commercial aircrafts through the modeling and structural-acoustic analysis of fuselage structures. The study focuses on how fuselage vibrations contribute to cabin noise and explores design improvements for enhanced passenger comfort.

Objectives

To model the fuselage structure using CATIA.

To perform structural vibration analysis in ANSYS 2024 R1.

To conduct acoustic analysis in ActranVI 2024.2.

To evaluate the influence of structural modifications on noise reduction.

Methodology

Modeling: Fuselage geometry developed in CATIA V5.

Structural Analysis: Modal and harmonic vibration analysis performed in ANSYS 2024 R1.

Acoustic Analysis: Sound propagation and noise transmission evaluated using ActranVI 2024.2.

Comparative Study: Assessment of different fuselage configurations for improved noise suppression.

Outcomes

Identified key structural factors influencing cabin noise levels.

Proposed modifications that contribute to noise reduction and passenger comfort.

Developed a framework combining structural and acoustic simulations for aircraft fuselage noise studies.
